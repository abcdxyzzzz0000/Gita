**User Story:**  
As a system, I want to generate explanations for daily wisdom shlokas, so that users receive meaningful daily content.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Explanation emphasizes daily practical application
- Tone is inspirational and motivational
- Length optimized for mobile notification (100-150 words)
- Generated during off-peak hours (scheduled task)
- Cached for the entire day
- Fallback to pre-written explanation if generation fails

**Definition of Done:**
- All stories follow the format: "As a [user type], I want [goal], so that [benefit]"
- Acceptance criteria are clear, testable, and specific
- Dependencies are explicitly stated to guide sprint planning
- Priorities align with MVP requirements and user value
- Stories are sized to be completable within a sprint
- Technical debt and infrastructure setup are considered in dependencies
